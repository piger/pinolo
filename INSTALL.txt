# Installation

## Requirements

Python version 2.6 at least, sqlite lib, event lib and the following python
packages: SQLAlchemy, gevent. For fancy text search you will also need to
install Xapian libraries and python packages (which IIRC are not
easy-installable...).

Ideally you should safely run the usual `python setup.py install` and get the
shit done, but first you must install all the C libraries with your distribution
package tools.

Debian/Ubuntu:

- libsqlite3-0 
- libevent-1.4-2
- libxapian22
- python-xapian

Python packages installation:

	# easy_install SQLAlchemy gevent

or

	# pip install SQLAlchemy gevent

or

	# aptitude install tuasorella
